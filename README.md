This is a Custrom Encrypter by me
With the help from a tutorial.
The special thing about the Encrypter is that have some characters that you need to translate yourself after traslate with computer.
the thing is that you need to know what is what.
example: 
a = #
then b#n#n# is banana
and in every time you will get that (if first code and second code are the same ,example 7 and 1).
if you want you can study by yourself and find out other traslates and maybe sent to us to see your study about the encrypt system.
i study just the case of 7(first code) and i put the second code and i see what is what.
--the most cases of second code--
Exist Special cases (but i dont know them)
Don't put Numbers when you want to encrypt somenthing!
